With the Blocks SDK, you can create your own custom extensions on top of Airtable. These extensions
can be integrations, visualizations, internal tools, and more!

To get started, check out the
[official Blocks SDK documentation website](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks). If you have any
questions, feedback, or feature requests, we encourage you to post in the
[community forum](https://community.airtable.com/c/developers/custom-blocks-beta/54).

This git repository contains a few related projects:

-   [The sdk itself](./packages/sdk) - this is what you use when building your extension!
-   [A blocks testing framework](./packages/blocks-testing) - this is used to help test your
    extension.
-   [The new Blocks CLI](./packages/cli-next) - this is used to run your extension!
